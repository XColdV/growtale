# Growtale - A Growtopia Private Server files.

Long ago, on late 2019, my friend told me to code on his Server, named GTIN.
Then we changed it to Growtale. One day someone named "Aziz" wanted to be our VPS Provider.
Long story short, our server has been quite famous, but not too famous though.
And this "Aziz" guy have access to anything including CPP, etc.
Then he gave the cpp to someone that are leaker, so i decided to Release the CPP on github.

So thats the story of why i leaked this CPP. And thank you for reading it lol.

You can modify, remake or use it without any credits.
Have fun editing it!
Also if you want to use this CPP, make sure to remove [+] if you're annoyed with one.

This cpp is made by Ipadtopia or me.
